This repository contains the webapp that acts as the front to [GNIS-LD](https://gnis-ld.org/).

## Building

To build the source, run `gulp` from the project root.

The docker images below should match the ones used in the [kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/DataONEorg/gnis-deployment).

When building a development docker image, run

`docker build -t gnislinkeddata/gnis-ld:dev .`

When building a production docker image, run

`docker build -t gnislinkeddata/gnis-ld .`

Finally, push the image to `gnislinkeddata/gnis-ld:<dev/latest>`

### Differentiating Between Production & Development

The main difference between production and development builds is the base URL. For example, development builds that are deployed on the develop cluster have address `stage.gnis-ld.org` while production builds have `gnis-ld.org`. This value is controlled by the `DEPLOYMENT_ADDRESS` variable in `config.app.js`.

## Running

To run the website, run the following from the project root

```
npm i -g gulp
npm i
gulp
```

## Developing


### Website Design

The website uses pug templates with less css. `layout.pug` holds the base template for each page. In it, it has the layout for the banner, page content, and the footer. The HTML for the banner and footer are generated by calling mixings. The page content is defined in an external file. Examples of these include 'about.pug' and 'queries.pug'. The content in these files are passed into the main template and the result is a page that should look okay with the rest of the site. If a page needs to have any content in the header (for linking scripts, stylesheets, etc), `block content-header` can be defined with the requirements.

For example, to create a new page called `news`, create a new pug file as `lib/webapp/_layout/news.pug`.

news.pug
```
block content-header
  link(rel='stylesheet', type='text/css', href='/style/news.css')
  script(src='/script/news.js')

block content-block
  body
    .content-layout
      .left-col 
      .content
        .page-content
          .news-content1
            p Breaking News Story 1
          .news-content2
            p foo
          .news-content3
            p bar
```

One shortcoming of the template is the tricky rule that every page must have, at a minimum in their `content-block`.

```
  body
    .content-layout
      .left-col 
      .content
        .page-content
```

New page content is inserted underneath the `page-content` div.

Next, add a route in `server.js` so that connecting clients get the correct page delivered.

```
k_app.get([
	'/news',
], (d_req, d_res) => {
	d_res.type('text/html');
	d_res.render('news');
  d_res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
});

Finally, add the page to the navigation bar.
```

### Build System

`gulpfile.js` contains the gulp tasks for building and running the application. Each gulp task accomplishes a small part in the build process. For example, there's a task for turning the less styling sheets into css and another for compiling the pug files. There are also higher level tasks that combine these steps, for example the `default` task (which performs a build).

One potentially confusing part of the build/content serving system is that _not all files are served from dist/_. The paths to the files (css, ontology files, robots.txt, etc) are defined in `server.js`. Some of the files are being directly served from the `lib` directory.
